# Interloko

Interloko is a communication platform. The ideas behind Interloko are still
rapidly evolving.

This project exists to explore some ideas:

* Collaborative environments.
* Tangibility and direct manipulation.
* Visibility and observability.
* Security approaches such as using and combining ACLs, capabilities
  and macaroons.
